I am a Master's student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland. I work on various applications of deep learning with a primary focus on audio processing and security. My latest research aimed at contributing to the insufficiently-explored valuable fields, including the explainability of biometric systems and their usage in streaming.

Currently, I am doing an internship at [Sony](https://www.sony.com/en/), Germany on Audio LLMs project. Besides, I had been teaching Deep Learning at [HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/), Russia and at [LauzHack](https://lauzhack.com/), EPFL. I have also worked at [EPFL LCAV](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcav/) laboratory for 4 months as Research Intern, at [Reality Defender Inc.](https://www.realitydefender.com/) for 9 months as Research Intern, and at [Samsung R&D Institute, Russia](https://research.samsung.com/srr) for 2.5 years as an assistant at the Biometric Solutions Laboratory.
