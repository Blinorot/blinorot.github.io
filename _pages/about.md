I am a Master's student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland. I work on various applications of deep learning with a primary focus on voice deepfake detection. My latest research aimed at contributing to the insufficiently-explored valuable fields, including the explainability of biometric systems and their usage in streaming.

Currently, I am doing an internship at Reality Defender, USA. Besides, I am a visiting teacher at [HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/), Russia and a member of [LauzHack](https://lauzhack.com/), EPFL teaching/organization team. I have also worked at Samsung R&D Institute, Russia for 2.5 years as an assistant in the Biometric Solutions Laboratory.
