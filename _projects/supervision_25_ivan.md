The project is conducted by my 2nd year student, Kazakov Ivan, at HSE (Coursework) in 24/25 academic year. 

Classical methods for the creation of audio effects consist of digital signal processing algorithms or analog converters. Using deep learning techniques, we can expand the creative potential and achieve new sounds that are inaccessible to traditional solutions. In addition, such algorithms can emulate analog sound without the need to buy equipment. In this project, we study approaches to creating sound effects and develop our method based on deep learning.
