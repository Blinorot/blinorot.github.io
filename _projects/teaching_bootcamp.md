Since 2016, [LauzHack](https://lauzhack.com/) has organized hackathons at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. We also organize tech talks during the school year.

In Summer 2024, we organized the first Deep Learning Bootcamp. It consisted of 9 days with 2-4 hours per day and covered both introductory and advanced topics.

**Topics:**
- Introduction: PyTorch, Deep Learning concept, Datasets, Optimizers, Schedulers, Loss Functions, FC, CNN, RNN, Transformer, Python Dev Tools, Git, WandB, Hydra, R&D Coding

- Deep Learning in Audio: Overview of different tasks (ASR, Source Separation, TTS, VC), Voice Biometry (a.k.a. deepfake detection), Neural Vocoders, GANs, GNNs

- NLP: Introduction to NLP, Past vs Modern approaches, modeling texts with RNNs and Transformer, seq2seq machine translation, text classification (BERT), text generation (GPT), and text generation at scale (LLMs)

- CV: object detection, image segmentation, and 3D vision (basics of volume rendering and implicit surface representations, NeRFs, NeuS, DeepSDF, and their applications)

- Guests' Material: DeepRL, XAI (Model interpretation), On-Device Learning, Distributed / Decentralized DL


This bootcamp was originally my initiative and I was the main organizer. My LauzHack colleagues, [Eric](https://github.com/ebezzam) and [Parsa](https://github.com/spneshaei), helped me a lot. We also invited many PhD guests from EPFL and ETH Zurich laboratories.

This Winter, we will do a Winter Edition.
