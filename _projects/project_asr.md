[Project GitHub](https://github.com/Blinorot/ASR). Year: 2022

The project aimed on the reproduction of [DeepSpeech 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595) automatic speech recognition. In addition, the code provides implementation of a LSTM with layer norm. The models are provided for two languages: English (trained on [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12)) and Russian ([Golos](https://github.com/sberdevices/golos) and [Common Voice 11.0](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets)). Project supports Language-Model-based beam search and Byte-Pair-Encoding for both languages.

Originally developed for the [HSE DLA Course Homework](https://github.com/markovka17/dla/tree/2022/hw1_asr).
