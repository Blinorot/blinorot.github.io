Project GitHub: Not Ready.

The project is conducted by my 2nd year student, Rymarev Lev, at HSE (Coursework) in 24/25 academic year. 

Open-sourcing the code for the research papers can speed up the development of new technologies, however, there exist a lot of literature with promising ideas that do not have a public source. This project aims on exploring the recent papers from top-tier conferences, such as ICASSP and Interspeech, reproducing some of them, and publishing the resulting code.
