Project GitHub: Not Ready.

The project is conducted by my 2nd year student, Roschin Vyacheslav, at HSE (Coursework) in 24/25 academic year. 

Alignment of music recordings with their scores is important for musicology research. It allows to create or supplement datasets that help exploring the musician techniques and developing expressive generative systems. In this project, the student's goal is to reproduce one of the existing papers (and publish the resulting code to support research community) or come up with a novel algorithm.
