Project GitHub: Not Ready.

The project is conducted by my 2nd year student, Paramonova Anna, at HSE (Coursework) in 24/25 academic year. 

Signature is an important part of person's authentication. However, as for other authentication methods, there exist different methods for falsifying data. The project goal is to develop a system that can detect signature forgery.
