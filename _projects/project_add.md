The project aimed on the reproduction of [LightCNN (LCCN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02683) following the Speech Technology Center [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05576), [RawNet2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01108), and [AASIST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01200) audio deepfake detection systems. The AASIST solution was written using [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Deep Graph Library](https://docs.dgl.ai/index.html) to supplement knowledge in the application of libraries for graph neural networks. The project was developed to ensure that [HSE DLA Course Homework](https://github.com/markovka17/dla/tree/2023/hw5_as) is doable by students in a reasonable time.
